# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Tested the wildlife conservation dashboard specifically focusing on the map coordinates after the coordinate corrections. The coordinates have been successfully corrected to use positive longitude values for African locations (East of Prime Meridian). The /api/translocations/clear-and-import endpoint was used to load the corrected data. Visual inspection confirms that markers now appear in the correct African locations, with translocations showing within Africa rather than in the Atlantic Ocean. The map displays 49 interactive elements (markers and polylines) distributed across Africa. The statistics panel shows correct data with 1254 elephants across 12 translocations, 27 black rhinos across 2 translocations, and 32 white rhinos across 2 translocations. Sample coordinates from the API show correct positive longitude values, such as '-14.843917, 35.346718' for Liwonde National Park in Malawi."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Tested the wildlife conservation dashboard to verify the historical translocation data import and coordinate accuracy. The current implementation only imports 16 historical records (not the 40+ expected in the requirements). The data spans from 2016 to 2022 and includes key locations like Liwonde National Park, Akagera National Park, and Zinave National Park. The statistics panel correctly shows 1254 elephants across 12 translocations, 27 black rhinos across 2 translocations, and 32 white rhinos across 2 translocations. The coordinates are correctly formatted with positive longitude values for East African locations. The map has some display issues with Leaflet JavaScript errors, but the markers appear to be positioned correctly in Africa. The data import functionality works as implemented, but the dataset is smaller than expected."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Successfully tested the complete historical data import functionality. After directly calling the API endpoint `/api/translocations/import-complete-excel-data`, the system now shows 49 records spanning from 2016 to 2025, which meets the requirement for 40+ records. The statistics panel now displays a more comprehensive dataset with 9 different species: Elephant (1101 animals across 21 translocations), Kudu (40 animals across 1 translocation), Buffalo (3329 animals across 8 translocations), Impala (221 animals across 1 translocation), Black Rhino (77 animals across 7 translocations), White Rhino (186 animals across 6 translocations), Sable (428 animals across 2 translocations), Lion (7 animals across 1 translocation), and Zebra (104 animals across 2 translocations). The map displays markers correctly positioned within Africa, showing the proper coordinates. The filtering functionality works as expected, allowing users to filter by species, year (including future projects in 2025), and special projects like Peace Parks and African Parks. Despite some Leaflet JavaScript errors related to loading OpenStreetMap tiles, the map functionality works correctly with markers and routes displayed on the blue background."
