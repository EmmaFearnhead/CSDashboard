# üöÄ Railway Deployment Instructions

## 1. GitHub Setup (2 minutes)

### Create GitHub Repository:
```bash
# Initialize git in your project folder
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Conservation Dashboard - Ready for Railway"

# Create new repository on GitHub.com
# Then connect and push:
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/conservation-dashboard.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 2. Deploy on Railway (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Sign Up
- Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
- Click "Login with GitHub" 
- Authorize Railway to access your repositories

### Step 2: Create New Project
- Click "New Project"
- Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
- Choose your `conservation-dashboard` repository
- Click "Deploy Now"

### Step 3: Configure Services
Railway will automatically detect:
- ‚úÖ **Frontend**: React app (port 3000)
- ‚úÖ **Backend**: FastAPI (port 8001) 
- ‚úÖ **Database**: MongoDB

### Step 4: Add MongoDB Database
- In your Railway project dashboard
- Click "New Service" ‚Üí "Database" ‚Üí "MongoDB"
- Railway creates database automatically

### Step 5: Environment Variables
Railway auto-configures most variables, but you may need to set:

**Backend Variables:**

### Custom Domain ($10/year):
- Connect your own domain like `conservationdashboard.com`
- Railway provides SSL certificate automatically

## 4. Post-Deployment Testing

### Test Your Deployed App:
1. **Frontend**: Visit your Railway frontend URL
2. **Backend API**: Test at `yourbackend.railway.app/api/`
3. **Upload**: Try uploading an Excel file
4. **Download**: Test Excel download feature
5. **Mobile**: Test on your phone

## 5. Ongoing Management

### Easy Updates:
